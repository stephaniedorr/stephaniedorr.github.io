	<div class="minor-headline1">Hi, I'm Stephanie</div>


			<div id="about-me-text">
				<p class="textcontent">My mom swears my favorite word as a child was, "No!"  Frankly, I believe it must have been, "Why?" or maybe, "What?" or "Who?"  I can't remember a time when I was not curious about something.  "Why does that work that way?"  "Why is that possible?"  "Who are you?"  "What's your story?"  For others it may have seemed annoying but, for me, it was my natural makeup.  I had to understand the story behind the story.  And, as I peeled away each layer, I refined my understanding of the world around me.
				<br><br>As I grew up and went off to college, I seized the opportunity to explore and travel by becoming an international exchange student in Taiwan.  Petrified initially at leaving my family and travelling halfway around the globe, I became more at ease as I met people from all over the world, heard their stories, and shared my own.  The more stories I heard, the more I wanted to investigate.</p>

				<p class="textcontent">After college I married an Army officer (and the love of my life) and spent the next 27 years traveling the world.  I have had the honor of hearing the stories of more people than I can possibly count. Along the way my own life story has taken many turns.  I have been an event planner, a philanthropist, and an educator.  Eighteen household moves have made me an expert logistician.  My husband's four overseas deployments have made me resilient, resourceful and independent.
				<br><br>Throughout the twists and turns of my personal life, my love for all things technology has remained a constant.  I wrote my first bits of code in high school.  As an exchange student I used the early Internet to communicate with my professors in the United States (remember the green screen with a flashing cursor?  Don't remember it? ...ok, moving on). 

				<p class="textcontent">As a young mom, I voraciously consume each and every ounce of education technology I could get my hands on.  As an Army wife, I designed and published newsletters, cookbooks, and on-line blogs and, as an educator, I integrated educational curriculum utilizing available technology.  
				<br><br>As we approach our 27th anniversary in the military I am leaning forward to the next chapter of my story.  Could I take a bold leap and build an entirely new career around this hobby that has been a constant stream of joy over the last two decades?  I have the right attitude and aptitude! Why not?</p>

				<p class="textcontent">After extensive research, I selected a highly reputable and challenging web design program to provide the perfect blend of design curriculum and coding.  I found Bloc.<br><br>As a UX Design Apprentice at Bloc, I have had the privilege of designing, testing, coding, and presenting my body of work to an amazing team of mentors and creative directors.  It has been a privilege to learn from some of the best and most caring designers and developers in the industry.<br><br>Every design is a story.  Web design allows me to express myself while optimizing the tools and talents, which have evolved over the years to produce a powerful story-telling ability.  Tell me your story and together we can share it with the world.<br><br>Let's talk!</p>
